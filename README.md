### About the Web App

The web app is hosted using <a href"https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>.

The Backend was done using Python's Flask framework, and in an attempt to make everything as modularized as possible almost everything going on in the backend is done using a REST API.

I first converted the CSV into a list of python dictionaries to make it a little bit easier to work with.  From there, I created a ton of functions in interactions.py that make it easier to filter data.

For instance, the most used function in interactions.py was the following:

```python
def incidentsNearLatLng(point, radius):
	# Returns a list of instances within radius of a long lat point
	dataset = readDataset()
	# Reads the dataset
	values = copy.copy(dataset)
	# This copies that dataset list so nothing is does to this array
	for var in values:
		# Goes through all values in the dataset
		if not checkInRadius((float(var["latitude"]), float(var["longitude"])), point, radius):
			# Checks to see if the value is within the radius
			dataset.remove(var)
			# Removes the value
	return dataset
	# Returns a list of python dictionaries
```

And I used something called the Haversine equation to calculate distances between two long/lat points.  This allowed me to filter out incidents to only show ones that happened nearby.

The data visualization is broken up into 4 parts:

### #1 Primary Map/Visualization

[![N|Solid](static/pt1.png)](#)
<p align="center">Primary Visualization that allows the user to navigate through a map of San Francisco.  Address autocomplete has been implemented using Google's Javascript Map API</p>

[![N|Solid](static/pt21.png)](#)
<p align="center">The user can input an address in San Francisco and the map will move over to center that address's Long/Lat coordinates</p>

[![N|Solid](static/nearByPoints.png)](#)
<p align="center">You can click nearby point to learn details about incidents that have happened nearby</p>

### #2 Reports by Residential Address/Predictions

[![N|Solid](static/example.png)](#)
<p align="center">After the user clicks "View Full Report" the web app will open another window showing details surrounding that Long/Lat coordinate.  <b>Note: The background is a satellite view of the address that was inputted.</b></p>

[![N|Solid](static/boxWithNoInfo.png)](#)
<p align="center">This coordinate is <b>NOT</b> a coordinate that's in the Dataset, so it uses nearby instances to make predictions about call priority and response time</p>

[![N|Solid](static/inputTime.png)](#)
<p align="center">The user can input a time and the web app will make a prediction about the type of call and response time</p>

[![N|Solid](static/boxWithInfo.png)](#)
<p align="center">The predictions are made using nearby incident reports</p>

[![N|Solid](static/buttons.png)](#)
<p align="center">After looking at the incident report, users can either go back to the residental map, view the Github repository, or view the additional data visualizations surrounding the entire dataset</p>

### #3 Data Visualizations

[![N|Solid](static/AverageResponseTime.png)](#)
<p align="center">Visualization showing average response time for each zip code in San Francisco</p>

[![N|Solid](static/MHH.png)](#)
<p align="center">Visualization showing Mean Household Income for each zip code in San Francisco</p>

[![N|Solid](static/NearestFireDepartment.png)](#)
<p align="center">Visualization showing average distance from a fire department for each zip code in San Francisco</p>

[![N|Solid](static/SFPD_Frequency.png)](#)
<p align="center">Visualization showing frequency of Non-Emergency and Emergency calls to the San Francisco police department</p>

[![N|Solid](static/openHeatmap.png)](#)
<p align="center">After viewing the Data Visualizations, users can go back to the top of the page and click on the large blue button to open the Heatmap</p>

### #4 Heatmap
